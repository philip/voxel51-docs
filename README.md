# Beta Version of the Voxel51 Technical Documentation

This is the source repository for the Voxel51 documentation site -
[https://beta-docs.voxel51.com](https://beta-docs.voxel51.com)

We love pull requests - everything from typos to full Jupyter Notebooks.

At its most simple, you can fork the repo in GitHub,
make and commit your edits, and then open a PR.
A step above would be setting up local development.

## Editing the markdown documentation (under /docs)

To install and edit the general docs doc:

1. Make and activate a virtual environment,
   we recommend you to use **Python 3.11** for this.

    ```python
    # Create a virtual environment named '.venv'
    python3 -m venv .venv

    # Activate the virtual environment
    source .venv/bin/activate

    # On linux/mac/Windows WSL
    source .venv\bin\activate

    # On windows in Powershell
    source .venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

1. Be in the root directory of the repo and install the dependencies

    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

1. Serve the docs

    ```shell
    mkdocs serve --dirty
    ```

   The `--dirty` flag specifies that if you edit a single file, mkdocs serve will
   only rebuild that one file rather than the entire documentation site.
   To do a clean build and force mkdocs to build everything run

   ```shell
   mkdocs serve
   ```

   Clean is the default behavior.
1. PARTY!

If you find errors while executing `mkdocs serve` related to the `docs/api`
and `docs/ts_api` folders delete their symlinks and rerun the command.

## Building the Entire Site

To build the entire doc site (only been test on Linux)

1. Follow steps 1-3 above
1. `./build.sh --venv <location of the venv you created in step 1 above>`
    1. The script will first clone the fiftyone repo, then build the API docs,
       then encode and embed images in jupyter notebooks,
       and finally will build the entire site
    1. You will see a lot of log output with some warnings.
       Those are expected, ignore for now
1. The built site will now be in a directory named "site".
   This directory is sister directory to the docs directory
1. To get the site to render properly you need to open it in a web server.
   Most IDEs have a built in web server that will allow you
   to serve up the directory as a web site.
    1. VSCode has Live Preview - <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server>
    1. Jetbrains products has a live preview as well - <https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/editing-html-files.html>
    1. If you already have python on your machine, at the terminal, change into the
       `site` directory and execute the following command `python3 -m http.server`.
       This will spin up a simple web server.
1. Celebration!

To build the API docs along with the general docs you should use build.sh
